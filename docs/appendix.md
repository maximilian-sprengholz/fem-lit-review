# Introduction

## Scope

This online appendix supplements the literature review _The labor market integration of immigrant women in Europe. A review_ by [Bentley Schieckoff](mailto:bentley.schieckoff@uni-konstanz.de), University of Konstanz, and [Maximilian Sprengholz](mailto:maximilian.sprengholz@hu-berlin.de), Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (2021, mimeo). We provide descriptive statistics on:

1. Immigrant population in Europe (2019)
    - Immigrant population by gender and origin group (EU vs. non-EU) across destination countries
    - Top 5 countries of origin by gender and destination country
2. Labor market outcomes of immigrants
    - Outcomes and gaps in outcomes by nativity and gender across destination countries (2019/2014)
    - Trends in nativity and gender gaps by origin groups across destination countries (1995-2019)
    - Outcomes:
        - Labor force participation rates (2019, trend)
        - Unemployment rates (2019, trend)
        - Part-time employment rates (2019, trend)
        - Temporary employment rates (2019, trend)
        - Overqualification rates (2014 only)

We highlight just a few facets of the presented data in the manuscript, a lot more can be explored here.

## Data

<p class="warn">
We define immigrants as persons who reside in a country in which they were not born (For). In some cases, we additionally differentiate by immigrant origin group: EU-born (EU) or non-EU born (TC). Natives (Nat) are not foreign-born.
</p>

We use two different datasets. Immigrant population estimates are based on [UNDESA data](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates19.asp) and are not restricted by age. Data on labor market outcomes come from Eurostat for individuals between age 15 and 64, see data for [labor force participation](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/product?code=lfsa_argacob), [unemployment](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/product?code=lfsa_urgacob), [part-time employment](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/product?code=lfsa_eppgacob), [temporary employment](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/product?code=lfsa_etpgacob), and [overqualification](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/product?code=lfso_14loq).

We provide some additional notes on the respective samples and measures in the figure notes. For measurement details, please see the documentations provided on the linked webpages.

The order of presentation of destination countries corresponds to a (history based) grouping into north-western Europe (NWE), southern Europe (SE), and central and eastern Europe (CEE). We restrict destinations to countries for which data is available from both UNDESA and Eurostat:

| Destination Country Group | Countries |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| North-western Europe | Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK |
| Southern Europe | Greece, Malta, Italy, Portugal, Spain |
| Central and eastern Europe | Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia |
